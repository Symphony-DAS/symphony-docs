# Rig Descriptions

A `RigDescription` describes the devices in an electrophysiology setup. In a typical setup, each amplifier channel, any stimulation or monitoring devices (such as an LED, valve, temperature controller, light meter, etc.) is represented by a distinct device within a `RigDescription`.
